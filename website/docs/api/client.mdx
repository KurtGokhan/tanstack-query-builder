The Client API provides imperative methods, similar to how QueryClient and QueryCache can be used in Tanstack Query.
It can be accessed via [`builder.client`](./builder#client) in the `QueryBuilder` instance. Available methods are:

```ts
ensureData(vars, queryOptions): Promise<Data>;
ensureInfiniteData(vars, paginationOptions): Promise<InfiniteData>;
refetch(vars, queryFilters, refetchOptions): Promise<void>;
fetch(vars, queryOptions): Promise<Data>;
fetchInfinite(vars, queryOptions): Promise<InfiniteData>;
isFetching(vars, queryFilters): number;
prefetch(vars, queryOptions): Promise<Data>;
prefetchInfinite(vars, paginationOptions): Promise<InfiniteData>;
reset(vars, queryFilters, resetOptions): Promise<void>;
remove(vars, queryFilters): void;
cancel(vars, queryFilters, cancelOptions): Promise<void>;
invalidate(vars, queryFilters, invalidateOptions): Promise<void>;
getData(vars, queryFilters): Data | undefined;
setData(vars, updater, setDataOptions): Data | undefined;
getState(vars): QueryState;
getMutation(vars, mutationFilters): Mutation;
isMutating(vars, mutationFilters): number;
mutate(vars, mutationOptions): Promise<Data>;
```

The main use case for these methods is to manipulate the cache outside of React components.
For example, you can use `ensureData` in a router before the route is loaded,
to ensure that the data for a specific article is in the cache, and if not, fetch it from the server.

Most of these methods correspond to the methods in [`QueryClient`](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/reference/QueryClient) of Tanstack Query. For example, `ensureData` is similar to `ensureQueryData`, and `refetch` is similar to `refetchQueries`.
The main difference is that these methods are pre-populated with the variables in the builder, so you don't need to pass them again. For example, suppose we have a builder like this:

```ts
const articlesQuery = builder.withPath("/articles/:id").withData<ArticleData>();
```

We can fetch the data for a specific article imperatively like this:

```ts
const article = await articlesQuery.client.fetch({ params: { id: 1 } });
```
